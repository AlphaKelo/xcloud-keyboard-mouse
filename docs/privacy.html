        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Last updated: January 24, 2022</p>

        <p>
          The "Keyboard & Mouse for Xbox xCloud" browser extension ("We") <strong class="standout">do not store,
            send, or otherwise access any data about you.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>We don't even use an anlytics provider inside the extension, or have an application server to send data to.</p>

        <p>
          The only network connections the "Keyboard & Mouse for Xbox xCloud" browser extension makes are the built-in
          browser's "sync" storage service (which is only used to synchronize your saved settings between your browsers),
          as well as <a href="https://extensionpay.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ExtensionPay</a>,
          a third party payment provider (privacy policy visible on the "FAQ" section of
          <a href="https://extensionpay.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://extensionpay.com</a>).

          <a href="https://idolize.github.io/xcloud-keyboard-mouse/">https://idolize.github.io/xcloud-keyboard-mouse/</a>,
          does use a very basic analytics provider
          (<a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Goatcounter</a>)
          to track pageviews - but no personal data is tracked or stored.
