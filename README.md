***ðŸŽ® No controller? No problem!***

A browser extension to control any game on [Xbox Cloud Gaming (Project xCloud)](https://xbox.com/play)  with a keyboard and mouse.

## The issue with xCloud

Microsoft's cloud gaming service [Xbox Cloud Gaming (aka Project xCloud)](https://xbox.com/play) lets you play your favorite Xbox games in the cloud, but it runs on phsyical Xbox **consoles** (not PCs) behind the scenes.

Since very few games on Xbox consoles support mouse and keyboard as first-class input devices, Microsoft chose to limit xCloud users to only using gamepad controllers to play (although [maybe they will add PC servers eventually](https://twitter.com/XboxP3/status/1384154390630592521), but I wouldn't hold my breath).

So, if you don't have a controller or just prefer to use a mouse and keyboard you are out of luck!

Or at least you *were*...

## Features

### âœ… Works for every game

- Every game on xCloud is supported - regardless of whether or not it natively supports mouse and keyboard

### âœ… Multiple presets

- Manage multiple preset and custom configurations (e.g. create separate presets for "fighting games", "shooter", etc.)
- Bind multiple keyboard keys or mouse buttons to any controller button

### âœ… Quick enable/disable

- Easily disable the mouse/keyboard override and switch back to your controller whenever you feel like it with one click of the toggle

### âœ… Configurable sensitivity

- Control how sensitive you want mouse movement to be on a per-profile basis
- (Note you may also need to tweak the control sensitivity in the game options as well for optimial use)

## How it works

This extension works by acting as a **"virtual" controller**. It listens for keyboard presses and (optionally) mouse movement and translates these into what appear as *controller* button presses and analog stick movements.

There is no added input delay introduced by this extension - all keyboard/mouse input is instantly translated into virtual controller input immediately by the extension without any extra software or steps.
